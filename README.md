# Quip [![build](https://github.com/c-cube/quip/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-cube/quip/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Quick Proof, a proof format for first-order and higher-order theorem provers.
This repo contains a proof checker.

It depends on [Trustee](https://github.com/c-cube/trustee) as a kernel of trust for
some inference rules (in particular, the congruence closure).

**note**: this is work-in-progress.
